== Welcome - Snowball Fighting Game==

==Unique Selling Point==
Snow-based resource system. Snow is easily available but also universally used for almost any action in the game from fighting to building structures.

==Features==
3 basic types of terrain types - Snow, Ice and cleared terrain.

* **Snow** - An infinite source of the snow used for fighting and building. Extensively covers the edges of the level area. Sparsely available in piles or patches in the middle. Slower than usual to move over.

* **Ice** - Slippery. Can be built upon. Players can slide along on it. Changing direction of movement is not instant on it.

* **Cleared terrain** - Can be moved over at normal speed, but does not provide any other benefits. Usually forms roads that provides fast access points to enemy territory and thus possible choke-points to defend. Can also form exposed areas.

* **Snow resource** - Snow is collected from snowy ground or other sources like destroyed snow buildings. It is used as ammunition for throwing snowballs and other attacks that use snow and also for building structures out of snow.

==Player==
* Has a body temperature

* Can carry a certain amount of snow

* Is incapacitated when temperature drops enough. Speed increases, but can take no other actions until temperature is raised again at starting point

*Can slide on his knees over icy terrain for a speed boost at the expense of steering.

==Weapons==
* Snowball (basic attack that lower body temperature)

* Hard-packed Snowball (staggers opponent in addition to lowering body temperature)

* Dumping snow down the neck (melee attack from behind, lowers body temperature a lot)

==Buildable Structures==
* Small walls used for cover. Can be deconstructed to recover snow

* The snow fortress - contain various upgrades that provides additional weapons and tools

==Equipment==
* **Warm water** (regenerates body temperature, can be used to melt structures, slowly melts snow carried by the player)

* **Hot cocoa** (one-use item that raises body temperature. Can be given to incapacitated players as well)

* **Clothing** - Either light or heavy. Light is easier to move in but player starts with lower body temperature. Heavy is more restrictive but temperature starts higher and hard-packed snow has less effect

* **Sled** - either used for faster movement or as a mobile pile of snow.

==Level Example==
Level is dominated by a large, frozen lake in the middle with small, snow-covered islands in it. Area around the edge of the lake is covered in snow with cleared paths with partial cover from the lake. Teams start on opposite sides of the lakes in safe areas that can be exited, but not re-entered. Snow fortresses can be constructed on pre-determined points at the edge of the lake. Control points on the lake and around it can be captured to provide forward fortresses.

==Ideas (Write you name behind the idea so we can talk about it)==
Catching a thrown snowball. I remember as a kid you could sometimes catch snowballs coming towards you. It might change the dynamic if you can catch others snowball when you don't have any more your self. - Anyway just a thought. (Klaus)

I had few thought as well related to the warming up action and the buildings. In the first case I was thinking about warming the player up using the movement of the body. For example when the player is getting close to the freezing threshold, she could press repeatedly (for instance) key A for moving one leg and afterward key B for the other leg so it starts to move herself and warm up. I took this idea from that part of Final Fantasy VII where the player has to climb up a snowy mountain taking care of warming up at some points. Here is a video of that (the woman that comments it is so annoying sorry): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxGyVI_tIdo. About the buildings, I was thinking about making necessary to build a unique building in order to be able to win the other team. For example first you need to complete an igloo, then you have to upgrade it into a tower and then to a palace, so the first one that reaches the palace wins. On the meanwhile both teams are attacking each other in order to avoid the other team finishing the necessary structure. (Juan)

What if when you run home to get warm coco you would cry loudly be unable to duck so that people could pummel you with snowballs. (Klaus)

==Game mode: Playground domination!==
Capture points like we know from battlefield 1942 etc. - But short round based. Capturing a specific point will give a bonus in the next round. Building a snow castle on a capture point will give a bigger bonus, possibly make the capture point safe for the next round. We should possibly think of a rubberband effect in case one team starts to dominate.

==Art==
There are many visual styles we have on the pitch presentation representing what we envision our visual style to be. In addition, we can look at the South Park Tower defense game for inspiration about their visual style as well, since their gameplay is also about playing tower defense where players throw snowballs at the creeps (Ginger Kids).
